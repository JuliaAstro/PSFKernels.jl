# PSFKernels

Statistical kernels for constructing point-spread functions (PSFs). These kernels act like matrices but without allocating any memory, which makes them efficient to fit and apply.

## Kernels

The following kernels are currently implemented
* [`PSFKernels.Gaussian`](@ref)
* [`PSFKernels.AiryDisk`](@ref)
* [`PSFKernels.Moffat`](@ref)

## Usage

Using the kernels should feel just like an array. In fact, `PSFKernels.PSFKernel <: AbstractMatrix`. However, no data is stored and no allocations have to be made. In other words, representing the kernels as matrices is merely a convenience, since typically astronomical data is stored in dense arrays.

```jldoctest kernel
julia> k = PSFKernels.Gaussian(5); # fwhm of 5 pixels, centered at (0, 0)

julia> k[0, 0]
1.0
```
because the kernel is a matrix, it needs to have a size. In this case, the size is `maxsize * FWHM` pixels, centered around the origin, and rounded up. We can see how this alters the indices from a typical `Matrix`

```jldoctest kernel
julia> size(k)
(17, 17)

julia> axes(k)
(-8:8, -8:8)
```
if we want to collect the kernel into a dense matrix, regardless of the indexing (e.g. to prepare for cross-correlation), we can simply

```jldoctest kernel
julia> stamp = collect(k);
```

these axes are merely a convenience for bounding the kernel, since they accept any real number as input. 

```jldoctest kernel
julia> k[100, 10000] # valid for index-like inputs
0.0

julia> k(2.4, 1.7) # valid for any number
0.38315499005194587
```

By bounding the kernel, we get a cutout which can be applied to arrays with much larger dimensions without having to iterate over the whole matrix

```jldoctest
julia> big_mat = ones(101, 101);

julia> small_kern = PSFKernels.Gaussian(51, 51, 2); # center of big_mat, fwhm=2

julia> ax = map(intersect, axes(big_mat), axes(small_kern))
(48:54, 48:54)

julia> cutout = big_mat[ax...]
7Ã—7 Array{Float64,2}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0

 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0

julia> photsum = sum(cutout .* small_kern[ax...])
4.5322418212890625
```
Nice- we only had to reduce ~50 pixels instead of ~10,000 to calculate the aperture sum, and with some care we could make it allocation-free.

Since the kernels are lazy, that means the type of the output can be specified, as long as it can be converted to from a real number (so no integer types).

```jldoctest
julia> kbig = PSFKernels.Gaussian{BigFloat}(12);

julia> sum(kbig)
163.07467408408593790971336380361822460116627553361468017101287841796875
```

!!! tip "Tip: Automatic Differentation"
    Forward-mode AD libraries tend to use dual numbers, which can cause headaches getting the types correct. We recommend using the primal vector's element type to avoid these headaches
    ```julia
    # example generative model for position and scalar fwhm
    kernel(X::AbstractVector{T}) where {T} = PSFKernels.Gaussian{T}(X...)
    ```

    Kernels.PSFKernel{T} <: AbstractMatrix{T}

Abstract type for PSF Kernels.

In general, all `PSFKernel`s have a set of pre-determined axes (the size is set upon creation) but they are lazy. That is, no memory is allocated and the values are calculated on the fly.

# Interface
The interface to define a kernel is as follows (for an example kernel `Kernel`)

| method | description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Kernel()` | constructor(s) |
| `Base.size(k::Kernel)` | size, necessary for `AbstractArray` interface |
| `Base.axes(k::Kernel)` | axes, necessary for `AbstractArray` interface |
| `(k::Kernel)(point::AbstractVector)` | evaluate the kernel at the point in 2d space |
